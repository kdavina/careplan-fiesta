For the treatment of ADHD, the mechanism of action is unknown; it has been proposed that postsynaptic alpha-2 agonist stimulation regulates subcortical activity in the prefrontal cortex, the area of the brain responsible for emotions, attentions, and behaviors and causes reduced hyperactivity, impulsiveness, and distractibility. Epidurally administered clonidine produces dose-dependent analgesia not antagonized by opiate antagonists. The analgesia is limited to the body regions innervated by the spinal segments where analgesic concentrations of clonidine are present. Clonidine is thought to produce analgesia at presynaptic and postjunctional alpha-2 adrenoceptors in the spinal cord by preventing pain signal transmission to the brain.","Bradycardia and hypotension

Dequalinium lozenge,,,,quinolines and derivatives,,"Dequalinium has a multiple mode of action. It disrupts the cell permeability of the bacteria by absorbing onto the bacterial cell surface and diffusing across the membrane. It also binds to the cytoplasmic membrane with subsequent formation of complexes and protein precipitation and lyses the membrane in adequate concentrations, perturbing osmotic exchange. Loss of normal enzymatic activity is achieved through several different processes. Denaturation of proteins results in inhibition of bacterial cell metabolism. Disruption of bacterial energy production is mediated through inhibition of glucose metabolism and inhibition of mitochondrial ATP synthesis via inhibition of bacterial F1-ATPase. Protein synthesis is also terminated at the level of ribosomes. Bacterial nucleic acids are also affected through direct binding of the drug to DNA in vitro, and precipitation of cytoplasmic material with nucleic acids being the most sensitive 1. The cationic form of dequalinium accumulates in the mitochondria and promotes anticancer activity in human leukemia cells. It mediates a cytotoxic effect by altering redox balance in cells and downregulating Raf/MEK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways in these cells which leads to cell death by apoptosis and/or necrosis 3,4,5.

Target organs for insulin include the liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue.

Within the liver, insulin stimulates hepatic glycogen synthesis. Insulin promotes hepatic synthesis of fatty acids, which are released into the circulation as lipoproteins. Skeletal muscle effects of insulin include increased protein synthesis and increased glycogen synthesis. Insulin stimulates lipoprotein lipase synthesis and activity; this results in hydrolysis of triglycerides into free fatty acids and storage of free fatty acids in adipocytes, thereby reducing circulating triglyceride levels (Rawla 2018; Sadur 1982; Song 2019). In addition, insulin stimulates the cellular uptake of amino acids and increases cellular permeability to several ions, including potassium, magnesium, and phosphate. By activating sodium-potassium ATPases, insulin promotes the intracellular movement of potassium.

Normally secreted by the pancreas, insulin products are manufactured for pharmacologic use through recombinant DNA technology using either E. coli or Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Regular insulin has an identical structure to that of native human insulin. Insulins are categorized based on the onset, peak, and duration of effect (eg, rapid-, short-, intermediate-, and long-acting insulin). Insulin regular is a short-acting insulin analog.","Cardiovascular: Peripheral edema

Although the precise mechanism of action in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is not known, the efficacy of olanzapine is thought to be mediated through combined antagonism of dopamine and serotonin type 2 receptor sites.

This isomerized enzyme-inhibitor complex has a slow rate of dissociation, which results in high potency and a long duration of action; a CNS mechanism may also be involved in the hypotensive effect as angiotensin II increases adrenergic outflow from CNS; vasoactive kallikreins may be decreased in conversion to active hormones by ACE inhibitors, thus reducing blood pressure","Cardiovascular: Hypotension (11%)

Sodium phosphate fleet enema,,"Acute treatment of hypophosphatemia: IV: It is difficult to provide concrete guidelines for the treatment of severe hypophosphatemia because the extent of total body deficits and response to therapy are difficult to predict. Aggressive doses of phosphate may result in a transient serum elevation followed by redistribution into intracellular compartments or bone tissue. It is recommended that repletion of severe hypophosphatemia be done IV because large doses of oral phosphate may cause diarrhea and intestinal absorption may be unreliable. Intermittent IV infusion should be reserved for severe depletion situations; requires continuous cardiac monitoring. Guidelines differ based on degree of illness, need/use of TPN, and severity of hypophosphatemia. If hypokalemia exists (some clinicians recommend threshold of <4 mmol/L), consider phosphate replacement strategy with potassium (eg, potassium phosphates). Obese patients and/or severe renal impairment were excluded from phosphate supplement trials. Note: 1 mmol phosphate = 31 mg phosphorus; 1 mg phosphorus = 0.032 mmol phosphate.
